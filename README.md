# simple-sequelize
Minimal set up to get sequelize up and running.

# installation
First you need to install all dependencies by running : 

```javascript
npm install
```

# running the server
You just need to run the command `start` in the `scripts` category of the package.json file.

Like so 
```javascript
npm start
```

# contributions
If you want you can contribute, write tests, add methods, basically do anything you want.
You just have to open a request.

# thanks
The people behind sequelize and those of the express-example.

# additional notes
I am no expert, I just felt the need to share a simple project to help understand sequelize.
Learning is a long and tedious process, I just want to ease it for anyone.
